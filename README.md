# Secret-Santa-Simulator
Have a secret santa but don't have time to get together and draw names? Want to make sure the people you get are the people you want to get? This is your answer

Main parts to this project:

1. The user must input a list of names to be drawn (who is participating).
2. Each person who is enrolled is then sent an email (possibly) and is asked to rank the other participants in order on who they know the best (1 being I know this person the most to n being I know this person the least) (rank only as many as you wish)
3. The results from this are then encrypted and sent back to the program and stored in a database until all participants have made their selections. (Possibly a system to remind users when they have not responded, or an option to set a hard deadline)
4. Once everyone has chosen, the program then recieves the data and selects the best option possible in order for everyone to have their highest ranked person, while still having everyone in the group be selected.
5. The program then will email each participant of who they were drawn.

What separates this secret santa simulator from the rest is that this one is not random, in an office of 200 people you may only work with/know 10-20 people. Getting someone you have no idea who they are takes the fun away and discourages secret santa from becoming something for larger groups.

This program is still in the early stages of development and is far, far from being completed but will be gradual. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks
